# Overview

I am an aspiring software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast looking into various career paths. 

## Github Overview

Currently, my public Github is mostly populated with design projects or odd bits of code. The majority of my Github development work is hidden in private repositories owned by OU. However, I am working to expand my public code portfolio. 

In the meantime, for more recent code I have written please visit my leetcode profile:

### Update

The leetcode solutions are not as easily accessible as I had assumed. I will need to manually transfer solutions over to Github for ease of access.
