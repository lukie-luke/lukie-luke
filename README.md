# Overview

I am an aspiring software developer and cybersecurity enthusiast looking into various career paths. 

## Github Overview

Currently, my public Github is mostly populated with design projects or odd bits of code. The majority of my Github development work is hidden in private repositories owned by OU. However, I am working to expand my public code portfolio.
